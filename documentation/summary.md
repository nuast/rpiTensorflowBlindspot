Cyclists and pedestrians are 15 times more likely to be killed than drivers on UK roads. In a society where we’re trying to desperately to promote environmentally friendly modes of transport, we’re instead unwillingly discouraging them with the safety risks. The cyclist safety movement usually focuses on the cyclist, wearing high-visibility clothing and covering bikes with flashing lights. However, these methods are only effective when seen. In a blind spot study, 54.1% of respondents did not know what a blind spot was . Many cyclists get seriously injured or even killed in blind spots, especially when the vehicles are turning, hence for the need of our project; an object detecting blind spot camera that warns both drivers and those at risk in the blind spot.

When a bike or pedestrian enters the blindspot (both identified in code as a “person”), the driver will be notified through an audible tone and text-to-speech message*. The pedestrian or bike at risk will be warned through an 8x8 LED matrix hat attached to the Pi, placed in view of the vehicle’s blind spot that will flash a warning when detected, alerting the pedestrian or cyclist of the danger.

Many new/higher end cars can use sensors that appears to serve a function very similar to ours, but they do not classify what objects they are detecting. Therefore, these sensors can incidentally warn the driver about things such as shrubbery or other objects that do not pose a risk which can create a "crying wolf" scenareo where many will just turn off the sensors. In addition, many older or cheaper new cars don’t get such luxuries yet are much more common on our streets, hence being more present in accidents. In addition, this life-saving technology is often an additional and optional feature, often costing thousands to install. We decided to focus on a simple cost-effective, efficient and easy to set up project, costing only around £60, thanks to the low-cost Raspberry Pi 3.

Already, motion sensors and blind spot cameras have prevented many accidents, and we believe our project could help prevent even more by providing an automatic warning to those cyclists and pedestrians in vehicles blind spots or other dangerous positions, so in case of the driver being unaware, those in danger can take action. Our project isn't a replacement for driver awareness, but a tool to aid both those at risk and drivers of issues and dangers.

The project is open source. Manufacturers and users can use and modify the code as they wish under the MIT licence. This means that anyone can change or contribute to the project as they wish, although it should be noted that all code in the version submitted is original work of NUAST A.
